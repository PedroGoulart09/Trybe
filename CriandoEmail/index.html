<p>I am an experienced  Manager with over 10 years’ experience in the B2B industry. I have organized large events for blue-chip companies all around the world, taking responsibility<br> for everything from planning, <br>logistics, speaker and supplier management to on-site operations.

  I currently work at Company Inc. where I manage a team of 13 people. I am used to working <br>in a highly pressured environment and I enjoy using my initiative to come up with solutions to problems.</p>

<div class="p">
  <p>I would like to submit my application for the Administrative Assistant <br>position (CEP 011) at X Enterprises, as advertised on LinkedIn.

    During my two-years of working abroad experience as Executive <br>Assistant at Company Y’s, I have developed a knack for project planning and remote team leadership.
    
    I also became responsible for travel coordination, which seems to be particularly<br> desired for this position with the management staff.
    
    If you decide on moving forward with my application, I would be glad to be interviewed over a<br> videoconference or in-person at your best convenience.
    
    Thanks for your time and consideration.</p>
